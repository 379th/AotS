    safetyNotice: "Safety Notice!",
    safetyDescription: "The quest is not psychotherapy or medical help. If you experience trauma, self-harm, severe depression/panic — please contact a specialist. If it becomes truly difficult during the process — stop, pause, breathe, talk to family/loved ones or a therapist.",
    requestDescription: "To begin the quest, you need to form an internal request and evoke the intention to solve a problem, task, find an answer, learn, discover, etc.",
    whatIsShadow: "1. What is Shadow (in the quest)?",
    shadowDescription: "Shadow is also an archetype. These are our qualities, feelings and desires that are 'not given a place': anger, fear, shame, envy, need for support, need to rest, desire for attention. They are not 'bad' — they are just repressed and therefore control us from under the surface. We tell ourselves: 'I won't be angry', 'I'm not afraid', 'it doesn't hurt me' — and we suppress the experience. But it doesn't disappear: it goes into the shadow and invisibly influences choices, relationships and energy.",
    shadowImportant: "Important: Shadow is not a 'bad part'. It is life force and signals of needs that have been ignored.",
    whatIsArchetype: "2. What is Archetype (in the quest)?",
    archetypeDescription: "Archetype is support, an image/pattern of light/healthy force that helps maintain balance and direct shadow energy.",
    archetypeExamples: "Examples: Guardian (boundaries and care), Warrior (courage and action), Sage (clarity and observation), Creator (play and expression), Lover (compassion and contact).",
    archetypeImportant: "Archetype is not a 'mask', but support: it gives language, gestures and practices through which we support ourselves as adults.",

The nature of the cosmic game is simple: to discover with what new combinations, with what new karma, with what companions the player can re-enter the game and again strive for the state that is his true home. He can continue the game of hide and seek with himself or forever remain outside the game. Or he can return to earth to help others achieve the goal, taking on the role of a twice-born bodhisattva. The choice remains with him. No one else can choose.'",
